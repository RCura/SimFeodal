# Agent-based modelling to explore the combined effects of social and demographic changes on rural settlement patterns in North-Western Europe during the Middle Ages (800 CE to 1200 CE).

**The agent-based model SimFeodal simulates the emergence of enduring population clusters located around the castles and the churches in a rural region during the Middle Ages.**  In the course of time, population clusters (hamlets, villages, small towns) become more numerous; many of them grow (i.Â e. their number of peasant households increases) but some clusters grow more than others.
